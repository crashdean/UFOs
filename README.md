#  UFO Analysis

##  Overview of the analysis
The UFO sightings project was created to show ufo sighting information and to display that information in a table on a website.
The data for the sightings was provided in the data.js file.  The app.js file, index.html, and style.css were created and then placed
into a repo for the proper folder structure.   This aloud for the needed files and folders of the structure to be used by the 
wedsite.   The analysis of the project came form the app.js file which held the javascript for the table displayed on the website.
The challnge of this project was to create further javascript functionality with used filters for the sightings table.

##  Results

The initial website only had date as the filter for searching the sightings.  The previewed date formate was displayed for the user to type
the date and press search.  This function was coded in the index.html page inside a div container using Bootstrap as a css style.
